title: Eat the World

i was the
type of girl
to swallow

the world
whole ingest
it all

i felt too
much needed
too much

there
would never
be enough

love.

insatiable
endless
black hole

of
everythingness
starving

for
everything
i didn't need

malnourished
by placebos
of love

vitamins
called
successattentionmoneyfame

pissed o u t
unaware
into luxurious

japanese
toilet bowls
nothing

could touch
the sides of
my   crippling

black star
void jet-black
hole of noise

no
boyfriend magazine
cover chart sale

sold-
out tour million-
dollar contract could

satiate
my stomack-
ache for love

i thought if
i ate the world
i would finally

be full
i would never
be hungry again

i was wrong
of course i was
this isn't a movie

this is real
life a ragged
jagged pill of

a life
a whirl of

clothes cars photoshoots planes tears traumas studios trains

approve approve approve
try try try
grind grind grind

to be
heard, seen
valued, understood

by men
with no knowledge
of real womanhood

who held
my power in
their purses

owned
my choruses
and my verses

but now

i am free
of what i had
to sever

i am free
of the hunger
lighter than feather

i am free
of those men
and prolific like heather

i ate the whole world
and i'll eat it
