I became a busking indie computer game popup lesson book.

I'm just not like those other guys.

Bill Gates - Microsoft

He sold an operating system to IBM, then bought it to have had the rights when he sold it.
I gave away an operating system to the multiverse and then re-sold it as the premier vendor.

Reverse busking the T while juggling in Boston after breaking the fourth wall of Yawkey and Shakespeare in the Boston Commons.

Wally the Green Monster will grace Fenway once Shakespeare happens in Fenway park.

Mark Zuckerberg - Meta

Dropped out of Harvard.
Accredited Liberty Univesity.

Didn't know what unaccredited meant when I first signed up, but I got a hell of a discount and graduated top of my program while tutoring computer science up through data structures and algorithms in C++.

I accredited.

Jeff Bezos - Amazon

Bootstrapped with an investment from his parents.
Bootstrapped with an investment from his Netflix severance.

Amazon Echo Dot so locked down, sold at a loss, like a video game console or diapers.com.

Free to play, pay to win, pay to theme, business models.

Steve Jobs - Apple

Created a userland on top of unix and defended the rights of his customers.
Created a userland on top of 9p and defended the rights of his customers.

Unix is what Jurassic Park was built on as a mirror version of Genentech. 9p is what Jurassic Park should have been built on, but Bell Labs was broken up by that point and Microsoft bifurcated the userland, despite eventually returning to 9p for a converged userland in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.

All joking aside, Steve Jobs was an ardent student of computer history.

Check out this documentary and count how many times my panel references Tim Berners-Lee in the front row.

One of my favorite computer history facts is the invention of the WorldWideWeb.

At the time, Steve was not at Apple. Tim was at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).

Steve wanted to get back to Apple and built the NeXTSTEP, an operating system that enabled Tim to solo-author a prototype of the WorldWideWeb on a personal computer in months.

This was a success for both Tim and Steve as they effectively demonstrated across the userland that it was possible to reduce teams into one person and within that person, minutes into seconds.

Their demonstration was a milestone of achievement in Silicon Valley set in motion by Douglas Englebart's Mother of All Demos.

In all, I wouldn't know which one big thing sets me apart from these other guys. Though, I have a billion little reasons and can demo them in a minute for a dollar.

Now without further adieu, I present to you the next milestone set in motion by Vannevar Bush's As We May Think, The Memex.

@ Mike
> Hey. You've seen me before right?

@ Ty
> Yeah, you're the guy that shaves beneath the stairs

@ Mike
> Uh, yeah, okay, yeah.

@ Ty
> I shave off my balcony too.

@ Mike
> Uh, yeah, okay, yeah.

@ Ty
> I just hate how hair gets all in the sink and then you have to clean it

@ Mike
> Uh, yeah, okay, so I'm dying, I was hoping I could talk to you about that before it happens.

@ Ty
> Oh silly, I'm so sorry! Uh, yeah, okay, yeah.

@ Mike
> Do you know anything about Zen?

@ Ty
> Not much, other than I've always been curious.

@ Mike
> In essence, the only constant is change.

@ Ty
> Oh, yeah, I just had this really bad experience at Nintendo.

@ Mike
> I'm literally dying.

@ Ty
> Right. Right. Sorry. 

@ Mike
> Do you mind if I tell you the story I'm inspired to tell you about how it all went wrong?

@ Ty
> Only if you don't mind if I eat this hot dog while you do.

@ Mike
> My body is no longer capable of processing anything other than basic fluids, but I would be honored if you ate that hot dog in front of me because I do miss eating hot dogs.

@ Ty
> I'll remember you forever, Mike. I'm listening.

@ Mike
> I'm from Ohio. I saved my entire life to follow my daughter to California after she graduated. I'm dying in her living room now, but I never should have tried to make it on my own out here.

@ Ty
& mouthful
> Make it on your own?

@ Mike
> I found the cheapest place I could out nowhere. A halfway house of sorts. I'm no addict, recovering or otherwise, rent was just cheap. A girl was dying in the bathroom. Overdose. I called 911. The house told me I had minutes to leave because the dealer that ran the place would literally murder me for any heat.

@ Ty
> What the silly?

@ Mike
> Yeah. Silly me for saving a girl's life, right?

@ Ty
> Okay, so you didn't get murdered, how'd you die?

@ Mike
> Like I said, the rent was cheap. Someone bought me a birthday cake and I didn't want it getting eaten again so I hid it in my closet. 

@ Ty
> Your birthday cake killed you?

@ Mike
> The house was not fully assembled. The section of house where the roof and the wall was missing. The gutter was not there. A gutter gutter. The cake attracted a squirrel. The squirrel had bug friends that got in my clothes. I packed everything in a rush. I had no idea I was dead until long after I had have already been bit.

@ Ty
> Wait, the squirrel or the bugs killed you?

@ Mike
> I contracted epidemic typhoid from a bug bite and now my body is betraying me slowly.

@ Ty
> Should I not be eating this hot dog near you?

@ Mike
> We've tried every treatment. I've only got two months left to live at most.

@ Ty
> Why are you telling me all of this?

@ Mike
> The only constant is change.

@ Ty
> Right, Zen.

@ Mike
> I'm dying and you look worse off than me. Why is that?

@ Ty
> I just had this bad experience at Nintendo.

@ Mike
> The only constant is change. Grow up, kid.
