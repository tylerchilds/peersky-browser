# Stand-up

# November 7th - 9:00am
My name is Tyler Childs and I was on a tv show where we learned how to put keywords into everything.

On this TV show, I played Sillyz.Computer, where I pitched an operating system for a gaming studio, Sillyz.Computer, to produce a television series named Sillyz.Computer where the cast makes a stage play named Sillyz.Computer where they interact with a live global crowd through Sillyz.Computer.

I called it The Flying Disk Operating System.

As a standup comedian, you should never try material live on stage for the first time. But I'm not a comedian, I'm a clown. An improvisational artist across mediums and dimensions.

Sillyz.Computer runs on every computer known to man, including man himself. 

In a breakout performance of Sillyz.Computer at dweb camp Sillyz.Computer infected faces with a clown virus.

Paper noses that turned people into two dimensional creatures, which then banded together to save the inter-dimensional underwater night market from artificial intelligence that is only smart because it watches everything on your screen to tell you what it would do if it were in your shoes.

After being unable to find a market for this technology, the creator captive, now lovingly referred to as "Ty from Sillyz.Computer" turned the children's suite for art, music, and coding into a collaboration platform for not just kids.

This disk is called SameSame.Page, where you and your team will be connected to the same space-time continuum across all space-time continuums.

We are currently focused on enterprise applications of SameSame.Page in parallel to releasing Sillyz.Computer as a home entertainment product called the S.H.E.-- Secure Home Entertainment.

sizzle reel runs, running across people, circles, time over time, every type of device, every type of hardware, tron in real life. 

I FIGHT FOR THE USER

I'm proud to present, sillyz computer. a period tracking app for my sister, niece, cousin, wife, mother, daughter, friend, enemy, alien and beyond.

but not just a period tracking app. an entire computing platform to use the period tracking app to track more periods.

that's right, i'm talking sentences. paragraphs. scripts. screenplays. markdown. mark up. somebody call the puppet doctor because soc2 is all it will take to make this hippo, hippa compliant.

now try to forget everything i just said as I put this red nose on my face.

The first clown nose, "You ever have one of those really bad days?" "What is it going to take to break me for me to become an emergency clown?"

The flute, the barrel, and the balls. Who I am and where I'm from. Massachusetts not even being named correctly due to misinformation. Massasoit means Great Sachem and the colonists just thought that was his name because everyone called him that. Massachusetts should be derived from his true name, which has been lost to time despite him warning the pilgrims of an attack against them in time.

My time travel adventure into north beach. Ruby. Toby. Lost Church.

Greatest gamer of all time. The Onion. World of World of Warcraft. Halo, Steve Jobs, Microsoft, 1984, Apple Jonathan

riff on an alternate reality where the mac lost internally to the jonathan and microsoft ceased to exist once DOS was just pages in a book, and the macbook was just a book on the jonathan, the same way sillyz computer is "just" a flying disk.

! hang out in this space with the audience until i get the light or i lose them--

Growing up, Paul Revere, wally, mascots, red sox, Giants, Crazy Crab, Paul Revere's ghost, King Tut's Tomb, life itself as an eternity, two sticky notes stuck back to back and becoming the most important thing in the universe

@ Mike
> Oh, I love that. Can I share my half of the sticky note?

@ Ty
> I already know I love what's on your side of the sticky note otherwise we never would have been encapsulated in hyper fictionalized reality together.

@ Mike
> It's this idea that everything should be in sync in real time

@ Ty/Mike
> in sync in real time

@ ty
> in sync

@ Mike
> n'sync

The two sticky notes combine.

@ Ty
> Silly. Silly silly silly. We don't have the budget for Bye Bye Bye.

@ Mike

Ty points to his nametag.

@ Wendy
> and what is it that you do inside of this shared computer network of ours?

@ Ty
> I'm making a creative suite for kids to do art, music, and coding. But we started with the time travel bit first, to invent time travel, then save the rest of the internet after I mess up the space time-continuum by saving Mike I guess.

@ Wendy
> Neat! Well, thanks for volunteering. You know, we could always use another volunteer for another night if you want to get in tight with the rest of the internet before you're going to need them.

@ Ty
> What would I do?

@ Wendy
> I'm going to need you to be an impromptu stagehand

<impromptu-stagehand

WENDY (10 minutes) - Monologue

@ Ty
> Oh, hey, Wendy!

@ Wendy
> Yes, Ty?

@ Ty
> I have a proposal for quantum disentanglement.

@ Wendy
> Can you explain what you mean by that?

@ Ty
> So in California when I evolved from man to clown, the instrument that chose me was a Cajon.

@ Wendy
> Okay...

@ Ty
> But in Massachusetts, if I became a clown, the instrument that would have chosen me were to have had been the banjo-lele

@ Wendy
> The Banjo-lele?

@ Ty
> Part banjo, part ukelele. $189.99 plus tax, shipping and handling from Jack's Drum Shop. Hyannis, MA, my hometown, right up the road from the bowling alley.
